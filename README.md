## ES6 Module Architecture

The v0.6 version has been completely refactored with modern ES6 modules for better maintainability and performance:

- **Portal Transitions**: `/js/modules/portal/` - Hyperdimensional portal effects
- **HyperAV Engine**: `/js/modules/hyperav/` - 4D visualization engine
- **Audio Reactivity**: `/js/modules/hyperav/audio/` - Sound analysis and reactions
- **Content Management**: `/js/modules/cms/` - Magazine content management system

## Core Technologies

- **Quantum Particle Engine**: Reality-fracturing particle system with entanglement physics
- **Hyperspace Navigation**: Secret inter-dimensional navigation system
- **Portal Transition System**: Section-based navigation with ultra-enhanced hyperspatial portals
- **Reality Distortion**: Extreme glitches, tears, and dimensional fractures
- **HyperAV Integration**: Advanced 4D visualization engine with improved rendering
- **Audio Reactivity**: Enhanced real-time audio analysis affecting all visual elements
- **Immersive 3D Scrolling**: Transitions into the screen with depth perception

### Hidden Activation Methods
- Type "hyper" to activate hyperspace jump
- Type "millz" to trigger special message
- Click in pentagram pattern to activate ritual effect
- Find and click all sigil symbols for special reward
- Use arrow keys in konami pattern for surprise effect

### Sigil Locations
Sigils are scattered throughout the content. Look for special Greek letter symbols (Theta, Xi, Gamma, etc.) that respond to interaction.

## Getting Started

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the local server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Or use the run-local.sh script
   ./run-local.sh
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser (Chrome/Edge recommended for best performance)

### Test Pages

- Main magazine: http://localhost:8080/
- Module test page: http://localhost:8080/test.html 
- Integration test: http://localhost:8080/test-integration.html
- CMS dashboard: http://localhost:8080/cms.html

## Testing

Run the test suite with:
```
npm test
```

The project includes comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for all modules
- Integration tests for system components
- Import tests for ES6 module structure

## Browser Compatibility

For the optimal interdimensional experience, use the latest versions of:
- Chrome/Edge (full reality-distortion and quantum effects)
- Firefox (partial quantum effects, full portal transitions)
- Safari (limited support for advanced reality distortion)

Mobile support is available but with reduced quantum effects due to performance constraints.
